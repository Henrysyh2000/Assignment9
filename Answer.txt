1.2 the best case is O(n), when the list is given in a ascending order, i.e. lst = [1,2,3...,n]
1.3 the worst case is O(n^2), when the list is given in a descending order, i.e. lst = [n, n - 1,...3,2,1]
2.2 the worst case is O(n^2)
4.2 the best case is O(n), when the list is given in an ascending order, i.e. lst = [1,2,3...n]
4.3 the worst case is O(n^2), when the list is given in a descending order, i.e. lst = [n,n-1,...3,2,1]
5.2 the best case is O(n), when the list is given at the ascending order, i.e. lst = [1,2,3...,n]
